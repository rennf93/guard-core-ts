/**
 * Binary islands ported from guard_core/detection_engine/binary_islands.py
 * (upstream commit 5f399234).
 *
 * A multipart file-part payload whose binary artifact characters fill at
 * least a fifth of it is reduced to its printable runs before pattern
 * scanning: compressed or encrypted upload bytes stop producing attack-shaped
 * matches whose rate grows with file size, while text genuinely embedded in
 * an upload (a script inside a PDF, a stored path inside an archive) forms
 * printable runs past the minimum length and is still scanned in full.
 *
 * String model: artifact classes are evaluated over decoded code points, the
 * engine-wide body representation (invalid UTF-8 bytes decode to U+FFFD,
 * surrogate-escaped bytes surface as lone 0xDC80-0xDCFF surrogates). U+FFFD
 * and the surrogate range are part of the artifact class and are excluded
 * from the printable-run class, so binary bytes break islands exactly like
 * the surrogateescape range does in Python.
